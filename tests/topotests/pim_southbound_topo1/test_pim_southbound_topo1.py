                       h2 (source 192.168.3.10)

h1 joins 224.100.0.1 and h2 sends to it. Every router runs `pysbd`, which owns
the kernel multicast routing table: `zebra` hands it multicast routes over
FPM and `pimd` (loaded with the `pim_southbound` module) exchanges IGMP/PIM
packets and data plane events with it.

Traffic first flows down the RPT (r3 -> r2 -> r1). Asking r1's data plane to
signal JOIN_SPT (the way a vendor data plane would) then moves it to the
shortest path tree (r3 -> r1). A DATA_START on the SPT interface sets the SPT
bit, so r1 prunes (S,G,rpt) and the RP stops forwarding the source to it.

Without its emulation (`-a`) `pysbd` only raises DATA_START on its own for
kernel cache misses (NOCACHE), so JOIN_SPT and the SPT DATA_START are sent as
commands.

Finally r1 gets IGMP `join-group` and `static-group` entries (ASM and SSM)
on h1's interface, without h1 joining those groups. The southbound turns a
`join-group` into IGMP reports injected into pimd; a `static-group` goes
straight into the TIB. Either way r1 must forward the groups onto h1's link
and stop once the entries are removed.

Then the data plane reports the traffic stopping (DATA_STOP): r3 must keep
the (S,G) r1 still joins, and r1 must fall back to the RPT. Last, an IGMPv2
`join-group` must send its report to the group and its leave to all routers.
