### TODOs / Known issues

- skipping further tests after a TopotatoModifier failure is not implemented.
  A TopotatoModifier failure should skip everything after it since a failed
  modifier means the testbed is in an indeterminate state.
- some style requirements should be automatically enforced, e.g. missing
  docstrings should cause a failure.
- ExaBGP support is work in progress.
- terminal-on-failure (potatool) is work in progress.
- integrated-config mode for FRR needs to be supported.
- FreeBSD support has not been tested & updated in ages and is probably just
  completely broken right now.
- `pytest-xdist` interop has not been tested & updated in ages, it probably
  also breaks in funny and hilarious ways.
- add more self-tests
- protomato.js needs a bunch more work.
    - re-add xrefs lookup to source code
    - short-decode more protocols
- an `index.html` file should be generated with an overview of a test run.
- add a bunch of attributes on the JUnit XML with machine parseable exception
  location.
